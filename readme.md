	Members have access to the details of who viewed them (similar to Linkedin).
	Members can be informed (via email / alert notifications) when Opportunities become available that match their skills or search criteria.

Employer Registration

	Employers can view the Candidate Pool
	Employers can add individual job opportunities into the Opportunities Pool - Jobs

Opportunities Pool
Projects
	Employers can add details of projects and their labour requirements. This will be in the form of a project plan with a timeline showing the likely point at which certain types of skilled workers will be required.
	Members will be invited to Register their interest by sending an email targeting their particular skill if possible.
	Registered Candidates will receive a Reminder. If the timeline is long (ie more than 3 months) The list of Registered Candidates will be re-polled by email to ask if they are still interested in the job and a fresh opted in list will be sent to the employer.
